# Precompiled Azure Functions Revisited #

Microsoft has recently published a [blog post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/appserviceteam/2017/03/16/publishing-a-net-class-library-as-a-function-app/) for precompiled Azure Functions, which was based on this [wiki document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk-script/wiki/Precompiled-functions). However, the post has some missing gaps for developers to understand at the first glance.

This provides sample codes for pre-compiled Azure Functions.
